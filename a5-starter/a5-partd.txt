A5 Part D: Procedural SQL Applications in the Final Project
Collaboration: Asmat Kaur Taunque: ataunque@caltech.edu, Cloudly Ceen cceen@caltech.edu
Final Project Topic: NBA Hall of Fame

Part D Answers:
UDF(s): We could create a UDF to determine a secific player's career stats, 
for example, average points in a game by:

CREATE FUNCTION CalculateAveragePoints(player_id INT) RETURNS DECIMAL(5, 2)
BEGIN
    DECLARE avg_points DECIMAL(5, 2);

    SELECT AVG(points) INTO avg_points
    FROM game_statistics
    WHERE player_id = player_id;

    RETURN avg_points;
END;

Procedure(s): A procedure could be used to update a player's Hall of Fame 
status based on certain criteria, like points scored and years played like: 

CREATE PROCEDURE UpdateHallOfFameStatus()
BEGIN
    DECLARE player_cursor CURSOR FOR
        SELECT player_id FROM players
        WHERE career_points > 20000 AND years_played > 15;

    OPEN player_cursor;
    REPEAT
        FETCH player_cursor INTO player_id;
        UPDATE players SET hall_of_fame = TRUE WHERE player_id = player_id;
    UNTIL done END REPEAT;
    CLOSE player_cursor;
END;


* Trigger(s): We can use a trigger to update a player's achievements or records after
each game like:

CREATE TRIGGER RecordPlayerAchievements
AFTER INSERT ON game_statistics
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF NEW.points > 50 THEN
        INSERT INTO player_achievements (player_id, achievement)
        VALUES (NEW.player_id, 'Scored over 50 points');
    END IF;
END;
